    "description": "# About the Printful API\n\nThe Printful API is a RESTful API, that uses an HTTP protocol for communication. HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods are used to access the API resources.\n\n## Postman Collection\n\nYou can explore the API using the Postman collection:\n\n<a href=\"postman/printful_postman_collection.json\" download>Download Postman Collection</a>\n\n## Requests and responses\n\n### Request endpoint\nAll API requests have to be sent to this URL:\n```\nhttps://api.printful.com/\n```\nIf you are using a proxy, make sure that all requests have host header set to **api.printful.com**.\n\n### Request parameters\nSome mandatory parameters (like object identifiers) must be included in the request URL path\n```\nGET /orders/123\n```\nAdditional parameters can be passed as GET variables:\n```\nGET /orders?offset=10&limit=5\n```\nFor POST and PUT requests, a more complex data structure can be passed as JSON encoded data in the request body:\n```\nPOST /orders\n\n{\"recipient\":{...},\"items\":[...]}\n```\n\n### Response body\nThe response body is always a JSON object that contains a response status code (identical to the HTTP status code) and the result of the action. If the status code is 200, then the action was successful.\n```\n{\n   \"code\": 200, //Response status code\n   \"result\":{\n      //API method return data\n\t  //...\n   }\n}\n```\n\nSometimes the response includes paging information to allow to browse larger result sets by adding offset and limit GET parameters to the request URL.\n```\n{\n   \"code\": 200, //Response status code\n   \"result\":[\n\t   {\n\t      //Item 11\n\t   },\n\t   {\n\t      //Item 12\n\t   }\n   ]\n   \"paging\": {\n      \"total\": 12,  //Total items available\n      \"offset\": 10, //Items skipped from the beginning\n      \"limit\": 20   //Number of items per page\n   }\n}\n```\n\n## Error response\nIf the API call is not successful, then the response code is not in the 2xx range and the `result` attribute contains an error description.\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 404,\n    \"result\": \"Not Found\",\n    \"error\": {\n        \"reason\": \"NotFound\",\n        \"message\": \"Not Found\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn general, response codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Printful's servers.\n\n### Timestamps\nAll timestamps from the API are returned as integers in UNIX timestamp format.\n\n## Rate Limits\nPrintful API has a general rate limit of 120 API calls per minute. Additionally, endpoints that perform resource intensive operations (such as mockup generator) have a lower allowed request limit.",

      "description": "### Private tokens and public apps\nThere are two different ways of using Printful OAuth - **Private token** and **Public App**. If you are developing an API solution for your personal store, you should choose ***Private Token***. But if you are building an Public App that will be used by a wider audience, you should be choosing **Public App**.\n\n### Client types\nThere are two different client types - **Store** and **Account**. Store access level client is only able to access the\nspecific store. For _Private tokens_ this store is specified when the token is created, but for _Public apps_ this store\nis specified when the app is installed. Account level tokens on the other hand can manage all the stores associated with\nthe account. For the endpoints that require specific store context, requests should contain `X-PF-Store-Id` header.\nAccount level access currently is only available for _Private tokens_.\n\n### Scopes\nScopes are used to limit access to specific resources and their methods. Scopes are defined in the developer portal when creating a **Private Token** or **Public App**. Customers on **Public App** installation grant screen will see all requested permissions, so be thoughtful about which scopes to request.\n\nList of currently available scopes\n\n| Scope                    | Client type     | Description                                  |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| `orders`                 | Store & Account | Read and Write access to Orders              |\n| `orders/read`            | Store & Account | Read access to Orders                        |\n| `sync_products`          | Store & Account | Read and Write access to SyncProducts        |\n| `sync_products/read`     | Store & Account | Read access to SyncProducts                  |\n| `file_library`           | Store & Account | Read and Write access access to File library |\n| `file_library/read`      | Store & Account | Read access to File library                  |\n| `webhooks`               | Store & Account | Read and Write access to Webhooks            |\n| `webhooks/read`          | Store & Account | Read access to Webhooks                      |\n| `product_templates`      | Account         | Read and Write access to Product templates   |\n| `product_templates/read` | Account         | Read access to Product templates             |\n\n### Developer Portal\n[Developer Portal](https://developers.printful.com) is specifically designed for developers that want to interact with the Printful API. In the Developer Portal, it's possible to create and manage your Public Apps and Private tokens.\n\n### Acquiring Private Tokens\nPrivate OAuth tokens can be generated in the Developer Portal's [Token page](https://developers.printful.com/tokens). These tokens do not require refreshing and are valid until they expire or are deleted manually. Usage of these tokens is described below.\n\n### Acquiring OAuth tokens for Public Apps\nFor public apps to make requests on behalf of the customer, they must first acquire access tokens. In order to acquire these tokens, developers must follow these steps:\n- create an app in [Apps page](https://developers.printful.com/apps) of developer portals\n- generate app-specific installation URL with `Client id`, `Client secret`, and other parameters\n- redirect the user to app installation url\n- once the users returns to `redirect_url`, use `code` parameter to acquire OAuth tokens"

This URL must be registered in the app |\n\nIn this URL, the customer is asked to register or log in to an existing account. After authorization, the customer is redirected to the OAuth grant screen. This screen shows information about your app, and the customer is asked to accept the requested scopes. If the customer rejects the app installation, he is redirected back to your provided `redirect_url` with `success=0` parameter. If the customer accepts app installation, he is redirected to your `redirect_url` with `state={stateValue}&code={authorizationCode}&success=1` parameters.\n\n| Parameter | Description                                                               |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| state     | state parameter that was provided when installation flow was initialized  |\n| code      | authorization code that will be used to request access and refresh tokens |\n| success   | flag indicating that authorization flow was successful                    |\n\nAfter receiving `authorization code`, apps should request `access` and `refresh` tokens. To request these tokens, the app should make a `POST` request to `https://www.printful.com/oauth/token` page with the following parameters:\n\n- grant_type=authorization_code\n- client_id={clientId}\n- client_secret={clientSecret}\n- code={authorizationCode}\n\nIf the request is successful the following response is returned:\n```javascript\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"smk_GN0I1Os3OdfqzjJnTOWn1wlbqqq2Y2Pc10TS\",\n  \"expires_at\": \"1562157895\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"902LmW0sWNlY-mbrLhb6AgexkI6K4OFo3Hknak8HDhTy_ifB5SdoLH1QgV9\"\n}\n```\n| Field         | Description                                                                                                        |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| access_token  | this token should be used to make authorized API calls                                                             |\n| expires_at    | timestamp for the date when the `access_token` will expire                                                         |\n| token_type    | type of the token.

When `access_token` expires you must refresh it with the `refresh_token`. After refreshing tokens, you will receive a new set of `access_token` and `refresh_token`. If tokens are not refreshed within **90** days, `refresh_token` will expire, and the app will have to ask the user to reauthorize it. To refresh tokens you must make a `POST` request to `https://www.printful.com/oauth/token` with the parameters:\n\n- grant_type=refresh_token\n- client_id=`{clientId}`\n- client_secret=`{clientSecret}`\n- refresh_token=`{refreshToken}`\n\nThe successful refresh request will result in a similar response that you received previously:\n```javascript\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"smk_GN0I1Os3OdfqzjJnTOWn1wlbqqq2Y2Pc10TS\",\n  \"expires_at\": \"1562157895\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"902LmW0sWNlY-mbrLhb6AgexkI6K4OFo3Hknak8HDhTy_ifB5SdoLH1QgV9\"\n}\n```"

      "description": "Printful has a substantial catalog of blank Products and Variants. A Product can describe a specific type, model and manufacturer of the item, while the Variant specifies the more detailed attributes of the product like the exact size/color of a\nT-shirt or the dimensions of a poster. Moreover, each item in the Printful Catalog has a unique Variant ID. When managing Sync Products or orders, you will need to specify the Variant ID of the specific blank item, hence you can use this API resource\nto find the needed Variant ID.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\nIt is critically important to always refer to the Variant IDs (<strong>NOT Product IDs</strong>) when creating products or orders. Mixing up and using the Product ID instead of the Variant ID can lead to an entirely different product created or item ordered. \nThe Product entity is only meant to allow of easier browsing of what Printful offers.\n</div>\n\nYou can also use this API resource to find out the types of print files a product can be configured for as well as the\nadditional price each print file would cost (e.g. the back print or inside label print for T-shirts). Moreover, some\nproduct types allow for additional options (e.g. embroidery type and thread colors) - these options are listed in the\nresponses as well.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\nPlease note that the current Catalog API does not reflect the discounted pricing available in the Printful subscription plans.\n</div>\n\n**Important**: Jewelry products are not supported via API.\n\n**Rate limiting**: For unauthenticated usages, up to 30 requests per 60 seconds. A 60 seconds lockout is applied if\nrequest count is exceeded.\n\n### Size guides\n\nThe [Get Product Size Guide](#operation/getProductSizeGuideById) endpoint will return size guide data for the selected\nproduct.\n\nThere are three types of size tables available, as described by the following table:\n\n| Table type                    | API name           | Description                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Measure yourself              | `measure_yourself` | Measurements of the product to measure the body provided by the supplier.                   |\n| Product measurements          | `product_measure`  | Measurements of the product provided by the supplier.                                       |\n| International size conversion | `international`    | International size conversion – e.g. US, EU or UK sizes corresponding to the product sizes. |\n\nNot each table type might be available for the selected product.\n\n[See examples](#tag/Examples/Catalog-API-examples/Using-size-guides)"

Furthermore, for each variant, you have to specify both a blank product variant from our Printful\nCatalog and a print file. These two properties together with price and External ID (more on that later) will allow the\nvariant to be purchasable. Please, see the following sections for more details. Finally, please note that for technical\nreasons a product in your Printful store is called a Sync Product and a variant of that product is called a Sync Variant. The maximum supported amount of Sync Variants a Sync Product can have is 100.\n\n### Assigning a blank product variant\nPrintful has a substantial catalog of blank products and variants, where each variant (e.g. size and color combination\nof a particular product) has a unique ID, which we call variant_id. You can browse through the catalog via Catalog API\nto find a specific variant_id. Moreover, when creating a Sync Product at your Printful store, each of its Sync Variants\nmust be associated with a variant_id from the Printful Catalog. Furthermore, to assign a specific variant_id to a\nspecific Sync Variant, simply add it to the HTTP request body (see examples at the specific endpoint).\n\n### Assigning a single print file\nThere are two ways to assign a print file to a Sync Variant. One is to specify the File ID if the file already exists in the File library of the authorized store;\n\n### Limitations\n\n**Important**: The Products API is not intended and will never support creating and managing products in external platforms such as Shopify, WooCommerce and others. For managing your products from external platforms please refer to [Ecommerce Platform Sync API](#tag/Ecommerce-Platform-Sync-API)\n\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"files\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 12345\n        }\n    ],\n    ...\n}\n```\nThe second and most convenient method is to specify the file URL. If a file with the same URL already exists, it will be reused.\n\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"files\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/front.pdf\"\n        }\n    ],\n    ...\n}\n```\nMoreover, each Sync Variant has to be linked with one or multiple print files. The available file types for each product are available from the Printful Catalogue API. You can add one file for each type by specifying the type attribute. For the\ndefault type, this attribute can be skipped.\n\n```\n...\n\"files\":[\n    {\n        \"type\": \"default\",\n        \"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/front.pdf\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"type\": \"back\"\n        \"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/back.pdf\"\n    }\n],\n...\n```\nRemember that using additional files can increase the price of the item.\n\n### External ID\nWhen creating a Sync Product and/or Sync Variant you can specify an External ID, which you can then use as a reference when managing or even ordering the specific Sync Product or Sync Variant. In particular, when requesting a specific Sync Product\nand Sync Variant, you can use either the internal Printful ID or your External ID (prefixed with an @ symbol) at the request URL.\n\n### Native inside label\nPrintful previously allowed customers to upload a fully customized inside label. Since these labels had to contain specific information about fabric composition, manufacturing, etc. to meet the legal requirements, users usually encountered issues to\nget their labels printed.\n\nInside labels are printed on the inside of the garment and require the removal of the original manufacturer's tag. They're only available for apparel with tear-away labels. An inside label must include the country of manufacturing origin, original\ngarment size, and material information. To use our native label template you only need to upload a graphic (such as your brand's logo). The mandatory content will be generated and placed automatically.\n\n```\n...\n\"files\":[\n        {\n            \"type\": \"label_inside\",\n            \"url\": \"http://example.com/logo/123/image.jpg\",\n            \"options\": [{\n                \"id\": \"template_type\",\n                \"value\": \"native\"\n            }]\n        },\n],\n...\n```\nPrintful previously supported fully customized inside labels. These have now been deprecated. The ability to create orders with fully customized inside labels has been limited to only users who were actively using them in their stores before April\n2020. This feature is no longer accessible to new users.\n\n[See examples](#tag/Examples/Products-API-examples)\n"

The following order status types indicate those\nstates:\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>draft</strong></td>\n        <td>The order is created but is not yet submitted for fulfillment. You still can edit it and confirm later.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>inreview</strong></td>\n        <td>The order is being reviewed. It's not possible to cancel the order at this point. It will be possible to cancel the order when the review process is finished.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>pending</strong></td>\n    <td>The order has been submitted for fulfillment, but is not yet accepted for fulfillment. You can still cancel the order if you need.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>failed</strong></td>\n        <td>Order was submitted for fulfillment but was returned for review because of an error (problem with address, missing printfiles, charging has failed, etc.).</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>canceled</strong></td>\n        <td>The order has been canceled and can no longer be processed. If the order was charged then the amount has been returned to your credit card.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>inprocess</strong></td>\n        <td>The order is being fulfilled and can no longer be cancelled or modified. Contact customer support if there are any issues with the order at this point.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>onhold</strong></td>\n        <td>The order has encountered a problem during the fulfillment that needs to be resolved together with Printful customer service before fulfillment can continue.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>partial</strong></td>\n        <td>The order is partially fulfilled (some items are shipped already, the rest will follow)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>fulfilled</strong></td>\n        <td>All items have been shipped successfully</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><strong>archived</strong></td>\n        <td>The order has been archived and hidden from the UI</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\nTo sum up, the API allows you to create orders with status `draft` and then move them to state `pending` (both steps can\nbe done with a single action). You are only charged for orders that have been confirmed. If the order encounters a\nproblem after it has been submitted, then it is moved to the failed state so that the problem can be fixed and the order\ncan be resubmitted.\n\n### Asynchronous order cost calculation\n\nMost of the times, when you submit an order, we'll perform the cost calculation and return it in the response.\n\nHowever, we might not be able to calculate all the costs immediately, for example if the order contains a new advanced\nembroidery design. If that's the case, we'll automatically put your order on hold, calculate the order costs once it's\npossible, and then remove the order from hold.\n\nSuch an order will return to a draft status (even if it was created with the auto-confirm option) and will need to be\nconfirmed.\n\nYou can subscribe to the `order_remove_hold` event (see [Webhook API](#tag/Webhook-API)) to be notified when the order is removed from hold.\n\n### External ID\n\nExternal ID is an optional feature that allows you to link your Printful order with the Order ID from your system\nwithout the need to store additional data on your side. External ID can be up to 32 characters long and contain digits,\nLatin alphabet letters, dashes and underscores, however it is recommended to use integer numbers. Each order's External\nID must be unique within the store.\n\nTo use the External ID feature, you just add the `external_id` attribute when creating the order. Later, when you need\nto access the order through the API, you can reference it by both the Order ID and by External ID (if you prefix it with\nthe `@` symbol).\n\n```\nGET /orders/11001  - reference by Printful Order ID\nGET /orders/@988123  - reference by External ID\nGET /orders/@AA123123  - reference by External ID\n```\n\nYou can assign the `external_id` attribute to line items as well. In this case they have to be unique per order.\n\n### Specifying products\n\nThere are three general ways to specify a product’s variant when creating, updating or estimating an order:\n\n(A) **Using an existing product variant (sync variant) in your Printful store or warehouse.** To specify the existing\nproduct please use its `sync_variant_id` or `external_variant_id`, or `warehouse_product_variant_id`.\n\n[Example using Sync Variant ID](#tag/Examples/Orders-API-examples/Using-a-sync-variant)\n[Example using External Variant ID](#tag/Examples/Orders-API-examples/Using-sync-variant-with-external-ID)\n\n(B) **Using a Catalog API variant without adding a product to the store.** This method can be used when a Printful store\nhas no products in it. To construct a variant on-the-fly retrieve a specific `variant_id` from the\n[Catalog API](#tag/Catalog-API) together with print files and an additional options.\n\n[Example](#tag/Examples/Orders-API-examples/Using-a-catalog-variant)\n\n(C) **Using an existing template ID.** This method can be used when a Printful store has assigned templates without the\nneed to create products. To create an order please use the `product_template_id` and `variant_id` that will be added to\nthe order.\n\n[Example](#tag/Examples/Orders-API-examples/Using-a-product-template)\n\n### Adding print files\n\nThere are two ways to assign a print file to the item. One is to specify the File ID if the file already exists in the\nfile library of the authorized store:\n\n```\n...\n\"files\": [\n    {\n        \"id\": 12345\n    },\n],\n...\n```\n\nThe second and the most convenient method is to specify the file URL. If a file with the same URL already exists, it will be reused.\n\n```\n...\n\"files\": [\n    {\n        \"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/front.pdf\"\n    },\n],\n...\n```\n\n### Specifying file position\n\nYou can specify the image position inside the print area by providing a position object.\n\n<strong>Important</strong><br>\n* Each print area has specific dimensions, by default Orders API will assume that your file has to stick to those limitations and not exceed them. In some cases you would want to position your file outside the print area - to be able to do so use the `limit_to_print_area` and set it to: `false`.\n* `limit_to_print_area` determines if the image can cross the print area border. If `limit_to_print_area` is set to `true` then the request will result in `400 Bad Request` with \"Invalid position\" in `error.message` once the image crosses the print area borders. If `limit_to_print_area` is set to `false` then it will be possible to place image partially or fully outside the print area.\n* The (0,0) point is always located in top left corner of the print area.\n\n<strong>Steps</strong><br>\n1.Retrieve printfile dimensions [Printfiles](#operation/getPrintfiles)\n```\n...\n\"printfiles\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"printfile_id\": 1,\n            \"width\": 1800,\n            \"height\": 2400,\n            \"dpi\": 150,\n            \"fill_mode\": \"fit\",\n            \"can_rotate\": false\n        }\n    ],\n...\n```\n2.Specify file position for specific print placement while creating an order. Use `items` -> `files` -> `position` object as in the example:\n```\n...\n\"items\": [\n    {\n        \"variant_id\":4011,\n        \"quantity\":\"1\",\n        \"files\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"front\",\n                \"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/front.pdf\",\n                \"position\": {\n                    \"area_width\": 1800,\n                    \"area_height\": 2400,\n                    \"width\": 1800,\n                    \"height\": 1800,\n                    \"top\": 300,\n                    \"left\": 0,\n                    \"limit_to_print_area\": true\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n...\n```\n\n#### Example of positioning the 450x450 image on the front placement\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td> Position </td> \n    <td> Mockup </td>\n    <td> Payload </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n<td> Top left </td>\n<td> <img alt=\"Top left mockup\" src=\"images/position/top_left.png\" width=\"300\"/> </td>\n<td>\n\n```\n  \"position\": {\n  \"area_width\": 1800,\n  \"area_height\": 2400,\n  \"width\": 450,\n  \"height\": 450,\n  \"top\": 0,\n  \"left\": 0,\n  \"limit_to_print_area\": true\n  }\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td> Top middle </td>\n<td> <img alt=\"Top left mockup\" src=\"images/position/top_middle.png\" width=\"300\"/> </td>\n<td>\n\n```\n\"position\": {\n\"area_width\": 1800,\n\"area_height\": 2400,\n\"width\": 450,\n\"height\": 450,\n\"top\": 0,\n\"left\": 675,\n\"limit_to_print_area\": true\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td> Top right </td>\n<td> <img alt=\"Top left mockup\" src=\"images/position/top_right.png\" width=\"300\"/> </td>\n<td>\n\n```\n\"position\": {\n\"area_width\": 1800,\n\"area_height\": 2400,\n\"width\": 450,\n\"height\": 450,\n\"top\": 0,\n\"left\": 1350,\n\"limit_to_print_area\": true\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td> Middle </td>\n<td> <img alt=\"Top left mockup\" src=\"images/position/middle.png\" width=\"300\"/> </td>\n<td>\n\n```\n\"position\": {\n\"area_width\": 1800,\n\"area_height\": 2400,\n\"width\": 450,\n\"height\": 450,\n\"top\": 975,\n\"left\": 675,\n\"limit_to_print_area\": true\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td> Bottom left </td>\n<td> <img alt=\"Top left mockup\" src=\"images/position/bottom_left.png\" width=\"300\"/> </td>\n<td>\n\n```\n\"position\": {\n\"area_width\": 1800,\n\"area_height\": 2400,\n\"width\": 450,\n\"height\": 450,\n\"top\": 1950,\n\"left\": 0,\n\"limit_to_print_area\": true\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td> Bottom middle </td>\n<td> <img alt=\"Top left mockup\" src=\"images/position/bottom_middle.png\" width=\"300\"/> </td>\n<td>\n\n```\n\"position\": {\n\"area_width\": 1800,\n\"area_height\": 2400,\n\"width\": 450,\n\"height\": 450,\n\"top\": 1950,\n\"left\": 675,\n\"limit_to_print_area\": true\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td> Bottom right </td>\n<td> <img alt=\"Top left mockup\" src=\"images/position/bottom_right.png\" width=\"300\"/> </td>\n<td>\n\n```\n\"position\": {\n\"area_width\": 1800,\n\"area_height\": 2400,\n\"width\": 450,\n\"height\": 450,\n\"top\": 1950,\n\"left\": 1350,\n\"limit_to_print_area\": true\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n### Specifying multiple files per item\n\nEach item in the order has to be linked with one or multiple files. The available file types for each product are\navailable from the [Catalog API](#tag/Catalog-API).\n\nYou can add one file for each type by specifying the `type` attribute. For the `default` type, this attribute can be\nskipped.\n\n```\n...\n\"files\":[\n\t{\n\t\t\"type\": \"default\",\n\t\t\"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/front.pdf\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"type\": \"back\"\n\t\t\"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/back.pdf\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"type\": \"preview\"\n\t\t\"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/preview.png\"\n\t}\n],\n...\n```\n\nRemember that using additional files can increase the price of the item.\n\n### Creating orders from a template\n\nOrders API allows also creating orders based on the product template created in the Printful account without the need to\nadd the product to the Printful store.\n\nTo retrieve available templates for your account please use the\n[Products Templates API](#tag/Product-Templates-API).\n\nTo create an order from a template you need to specify a variant or variants that will be added to the order. It is\npossible to use multiple templates with different variants in one request. To achieve that please use the `items` object\nbelow:\n\n```\n    ...\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 4012,\n            \"quantity\": 1,\n            \"product_template_id\": 123456789\n        },\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 1,\n            \"quantity\": 2,\n            \"product_template_id\": 11235813\n        },\n    ]\n    ...\n```\n\n**Important note**: you can only create orders from templates for variant IDs from the Catalog API.\n\nMore examples are available [here](#tag/Examples/Orders-API-examples/Using-a-product-template).\n\n### Retail costs\n\nPrintful allows you to specify your retail costs for the order so that the packing slip for international orders can\ncontain your correct retail prices. To enable retail costs, each item in the order has to contain the `retail_price`\nattribute. You can also specify a custom discount sum, shipping costs and taxes in the `retail_costs` object when\ncreating the order. If the retail costs are missing, the packing slip will contain the Printful prices instead.\n\n### Native inside label\n\nPrintful previously allowed customers to upload a fully customized inside label. Since these labels had to contain\nspecific information about fabric composition, manufacturing, etc. to meet the legal requirements, users usually\nencountered issues to get their labels printed.\n\nInside labels are printed on the inside of the garment and require the removal of the original manufacturer's tag.\nThey're only available for apparel with tear-away labels. An inside label must include the country of manufacturing\norigin, original garment size, and material information. To use our native label template you only need to upload a\ngraphic (such as your brand's logo). The mandatory content will be generated and placed automatically.\n\n```\n...\n\"files\":[\n        {\n            \"type\": \"label_inside\",\n            \"url\": \"http://example.com/logo/123/image.jpg\",\n            \"options\": [{\n                \"id\": \"template_type\",\n                \"value\": \"native\"\n            }]\n        },\n],\n...\n```\n\nPrintful previously supported fully customized inside labels. These have now been deprecated. The ability to create orders with fully customized inside labels has been limited to only users who were actively using them in their stores before April 2020. This feature is no longer accessible to new users.\n\n### Ordering embroidery products\n\nEmbroidery is a technique which uses colored threads, sewn into a product, to recreate provided design. In order to use embroidery technique you first need to check if selected product support embroidery technique.\n\nIn order to do that you need to use [Catalog API](#tag/Catalog-API) to determine if the selected product or variant contains `EMBROIDERY` technique.\n```\n\"techniques\": [\n                {\n                    \"key\": \"EMBROIDERY\",\n                    \"display_name\": \"Embroidery\",\n                    \"is_default\": true\n                }\n            ]\n```\nAfter that you need to also get list of available embroidery placements. Those are listed under `file` property with `embroidery_` prefix. You can get list of all available placements in [Placements](#tag/Common/Placements).\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Example of file property</summary>\n\n```\n\"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"default\",\n                    \"type\": \"embroidery_front\",\n                    \"title\": \"Front\",\n                    \"additional_price\": null\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"back\",\n                    \"type\": \"embroidery_back\",\n                    \"title\": \"Back\",\n                    \"additional_price\": \"3.75\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"left\",\n                    \"type\": \"embroidery_left\",\n                    \"title\": \"Left side\",\n                    \"additional_price\": \"3.75\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"right\",\n                    \"type\": \"embroidery_right\",\n                    \"title\": \"Right side\",\n                    \"additional_price\": \"3.75\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"preview\",\n                    \"type\": \"mockup\",\n                    \"title\": \"Mockup\",\n                    \"additional_price\": null\n                }\n            ]\n```\n\n</details>\n\nTo create an order using embroidery technique you can:\n\n- Provide thread colors manually [See example](#tag/Common/Embroidery/Manually-defining-thread-colors)\n- Use automatic thread color detection [See example](#tag/Common/Embroidery/Automatic-thread-color)\n\nFinally, you can make an order using embroidery\ntechnique [See example](#tag/Examples/Orders-API-examples/Using-embroidery-products). Depending on the placement that you've\nused you need to specify the correct [thread color option](#tag/Common/Options).\n\n### Packing slip\n\nThe packing slip fields can be configured at the store level and overridden for a specific order.\n\nThe packing slip settings can be found in Dashboard at **Settings > Stores > Branding > Packing slip section**.\n\nTo override the packing slip settings for the order, you can use `packing_slip` or `gift` fields.\n\nBelow you can find an example or a packing slip for a shipment with explained fields.\n\n![packing slip](images/sample_packing_slip.png)\n\nField annotations:\n\n* **(1)** Barcode unique for the shipment.\n* **(2)** Store logo defined in the store settings or overridden using `packing_slip.logo_url` field. The provided image is converted to a grayscale/1-bit monochrome image.\n* **(3)** The date of the shipment.\n* **(4)** Packing slip number consisting of order and shipment IDs in Printful database, divided with a hyphen.\n* **(5)** The country from which the shipment is made. If the recipient is in the United States, this field will be\n  absent.\n* **(6)** Recipient address with phone, without email address.\n* **(7)** Store name. This can be overridden using `packing_slip.store_name`.\n* **(8)** The address to which the shipment should be returned. By default it will be a Printful’s return address, but\n  you can set your own address in the store settings (**Settings > Stores > Returns > Return address section**).\n* **(9)** The customer service phone number defined in the store settings or overridden using `packing_slip.phone`\n  field.\n* **(10)** The customer service email address defined in the store settings or overridden using `packing_slip.email`\n  field.\n* **(11)** Gift message. This is only present if the `gift` field was provided in the order request.\n* **(12)** The order creation date.\n* **(13)** Printful Order ID which can be overridden using `packing_slip.custom_order_id` field.\n* **(14)** The list of order items with quantities. The items’ display names are localized, using the recipient’s\n  country and include variant information such as color and size e.g. „Unisex Staple T-Shirt | Bella + Canvas 3001 (\n  Lilac / M)”.\n* **(15)** The packing slip message defined in the store settings or overridden using `packing_slip.message` field.\n\n### More Orders API examples\n\nSee the [examples section](#tag/Examples/Orders-API-examples) for more sample requests on how Orders API can be used in\ndifferent scenarios.\n\n### Custom border color option\n\nStickers can have a different border color which can be set by using the `thread_colors_outline` option.\nThis option is available in `options` for stickers. To showcase the usage we will use the order flow\nwhich will create order with a sticker that will have a red border color:\n\nEndpoint `POST https://api.printful.com/orders`\n<details>\n    <summary>Request body</summary>\n\n```\n{\n    \"shipping\": \"STANDARD\",\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n        \"address1\": \"19749 Dearborn St\",\n        \"city\": \"Chatsworth\",\n        \"country_code\": \"US\",\n        \"state_code\": \"CA\",\n        \"zip\": \"91311\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 10163,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"default\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.printful.com/static/images/layout/printful-logo.png\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"options\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"custom_border_color\",\n                    \"value\": \"#FF0000\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n</details>"

      "description": "The ecommerce platform sync API allows you to automatically assign Printful\nproducts and print files to the products in your online store (Shopify, Woocommerce, etc.)\nthat is linked to Printful.\n\n### Sync Products & Sync Variants explained\n\nEach product in your store can contain one or multiple variants\n(some ecommerce platforms would call these options) that the customer can purchase\n(imagine multiple sizes or colors of the same t-shirt design). When you link your\necommerce store to Printful, we create a copy of your product and variant lists\non our side - we call it Sync Products and Sync Variants.\n\nSimilar to your store, products that are sold by Printful also consist of multiple variants.\nEach t-shirt model is available in many sizes and colors.\n\n![Image](images/variants.png?center)\n\nThe purpose of Sync Variants is to let you link each variant from your store that\nwill be fulfilled by Printful with a design file(s) and specific variant from Printful\nproduct catalogue. When synced products are ordered, we'll know which Printful product\nneeds to be printed, and the order is imported into Printful for fulfillment.\n\nYou can configure each Sync Variant in the Printful Dashboard manually. However,\nthat can be quite a tedious and repetitive task if your store sells hundreds of products.\nThis API is designed to help you automate this process.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n<strong>Remember</strong><br>\nProduct data is not imported to Printful immediately after the product is \ncreated/updated in your ecommerce platform. Depending on the platform, it can take from\na couple of seconds up to a few hours for the products to be available on Printful.\nBefore the products are imported, you will not be able to update product information \nthrough this API.\n</div>\n\n### External ID\n\nExternal ID is a feature that allows you to reference Sync Products and Sync Variants\nby using the ID from your store.\n\nWhen requesting Sync Products and Sync Variants, you can use both the Printful ID\nand your External ID (if you prefix it with the `@` symbol).\n\n```\nGET /sync/products/11001  - reference by Printful Sync Product ID\nGET /sync/products/@988123  - reference by Shopify (or other platform's) Product ID\nGET /sync/variant/123456  - reference by Printful Sync Variant ID\nGET /sync/variant/@123123  - reference by Shopify (or other platform's)  Variant ID\n```\n\n### Specifying products\n\nTo specify the exact variant of the product, you have to use the `variant_id` attribute of the order item. Each\navailable unique item (including size/color) has its own Variant ID that can be acquired through\nthe [Catalog API](#tag/Catalog-API).\n\n### Adding print files\n\nThere are two ways to assign a print file to the item.\nOne is to specify the File ID if the file already exists in the file library of the authorized store:\n\n```json\n...\n\"files\":\n  [\n    {\n      \"id\": 12345\n    },\n  ],\n...\n```\n\nSecond, and the most convenient method is to specify the file URL.\nIf a file with the same URL already exists, it will be reused:\n\n```json\n...\n\"files\":\n  [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/front.pdf\"\n    },\n  ],\n...\n```\n\n### Specifying multiple files per item\n\nEach item in the order has to be linked with one or multiple files.

For the `default` type, this attribute can be\nskipped.\n\n```json\n...\n\"files\":\n  [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"default\",\n      \"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/front.pdf\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"back\",\n      \"url\": \"http://example.com/t-shirts/123/back.pdf\"\n    }\n  ],\n...\n```\n\nRemember that using additional files can increase the price of the item.\n\n[See examples](#tag/Examples/Ecommerce-Platform-Sync-API-examples/Modify-a-Sync-Variant)\n"

      "name": "Mockup Generator API",
      "description": "To generate mockups, first, you need to decide on which products you want them. API methods on retrieving products and\nvariants can be found in the [Catalog API](#tag/Catalog-API).\n\n**Note**: Remember to distinguish the difference between a product id and a variant id. Some API endpoints require an id\nfrom a variant and some from a product.\n\n**Important**: Jewelry products are not supported via API.\n\n### Print files\n\nA print file defines resolution which should be used to create a mockup or to submit an actual order.\n\nInformation about product variant print files can be retrieved from the [print file endpoint](#operation/getPrintfiles).\n\nFor example, a 10×10 poster requires a 1500×1500 pixel print file to produce a 150 DPI print. You can use higher\nresolution files to achieve a better result, but keep the side aspect ratio the same as the defined for the print file.\nThat means, if you use a 3000×3000 pixel file, it will produce a 300 DPI print. But if you use a 3000×1500 pixel file (\ndifferent aspect ratio) on a 10×10 poster, some cropping will occur. Print file's `fill_mode` parameter defines if\ncropping will happen, or the file will be fitted on the resulting print area of the product.\n\nSome print files can be rotated. `can_rotate` field defines this feature. This mostly applies to wall art products and\nshould be used if you want to generate a horizontal or a vertical product mockup.\n\nWall art print files are defined horizontally. If you wish to create a vertical mockup, you can rotate the file's print\nfile and the generated mockup will be in the given orientation. For example, 16×12 poster print file is 2400×1800 pixels\nwhich generate it horizontally. If you wish to get a vertical mockup, you create the print file as 1800×2400 pixels. The\nsame strategy applies when you submit an order.\n\nPrint files are often re-used for multiple variants and products. For example, a 14×14 poster uses the same print file\nas a framed poster. Most of the t-shirt front prints use the same print file too.\n\n**Note**: When you generate mockups there is no need to provide a full-sized print file. Mockups are generated up to\n2000px wide, so you can downscale your print file to 2000px. This will reduce the processing time on your and Printful's\nside. Print file image file size limit: 50MB.\n\n### Mockup generation\n\nMockup generation requires some time, that is why it cannot happen in real-time.\n\nWhen you request a mockup to be generated, a task is created and you receive the task key which can then be used to\nretrieve the generated mockup list. We cannot guarantee that after a certain time the mockups will be generated, so you\nwill have to check frequently if the task is done. The first request for a result should not be sooner than 10 seconds.\nSo plan that the generation task will be done in two steps - creating a task and the checking with intervals if the task\nis ready.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n<strong>Important</strong><br>\nURLs to mockup images are temporary, they will expire after 72h, so you have to store them on your\nserver.\n</div>\n\n### Process flow\n\n1. Decide which product variants you want to generate.\n\n2. Retrieve the list of print files for chosen product and variants. Use the variant print file mappings to determine\n   which print file you need to generate for specific placement on a specific product's variant.\n\n3. Upload your file to a public URL that matches the print file size ratio (or provide positions for the generation\n   request)\n\n4. Create a mockup generation task and store the task key.\n\n5. Use the task key to check if the task is completed. If still pending, repeat after an interval.\n\n6. When the task is done, download and store mockups on your server. Mockup URLs are temporary and will be removed after\n   a day.\n\n### Available techniques\n\nThe `/mockup-generator/printfiles/{id}` and `/mockup-generator/templates/{id}` endpoint accept `technique` parameter.\n\nThe following table presents the available values of this parameter.\n\n| Value         | Description           |\n|---------------|-----------------------|\n| `DIGITAL`     | Digital printing      |\n| `CUT-SEW`     | Cut & sew sublimation |\n| `UV`          | UV printing           |\n| `EMBROIDERY`  | Embroidery            |\n| `SUBLIMATION` | Sublimation           |\n| `ENGRAVING`   | Engraving             |\n| `DTG`         | DTG printing          |\n\n### Usage example\n\nLet's take an example. You want to offer users to design of their t-shirt.\n\nWe'll pick this shirt as an example\n[Bella + Canvas 3001 Unisex T-shirt](https://www.printful.com/custom/mens/t-shirts/unisex-staple-t-shirt-bella-canvas-3001)\n\nIts product id is `71`.\n\nLet's fetch some variants available for this shirt:\n`https://api.printful.com/products/71`\n\nWe'll choose a white and black shirt in M, L, XL sizes. Respective variant ids:\n`4012`, `4013`, `4014`, `4017`, `4018` and `4019`.\n\nNext, we need to get the print file sizes for these variants:\n`https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/printfiles/71`\n\nWe see that there are two placements available for this product - `front` and `back`. Posters, for example, will only\nhave one placement called `default`.\n\nBy looking up our picked variant ids, we see that they all use the same print file for back and front prints:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"product_id\": 71,\n  \"available_placements\": {\n    \"front\": \"Front print\",\n    \"back\": \"Back print\",\n    \"label_outside\": \"Outside label\"\n  },\n  \"printfiles\": [\n    {\n      \"printfile_id\": 1,\n      \"width\": 1800,\n      \"height\": 2400,\n      \"dpi\": 150,\n      \"fill_mode\": \"fit\",\n      \"can_rotate\": false\n    }\n  ],\n  \"variant_printfiles\": [\n    {\n      \"variant_id\": 4012,\n      \"placements\": {\n        \"front\": 1,\n        \"back\": 1\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- `dpi` For given width and height, this is the resulting DPI on the actual product.\n\n- `fill_mode` Possible values: \"fit\" or \"cover\". Indicates in what mode mockups will be generated.\n\n- `can_rotate` Posters, for example, allow rotation. If you pass the image in horizontal positions.\n\n- `placements.front` Printfile id.\n\nWe can see that the full print file size is 1800×2400 for back and front prints for chosen variants.\n\nWhen we know the size of the print file, we need to calculate the positions. Position values are relative here, image\nsize does not have to match the width and height of positions. When mockup is generated we will fit the position area\ninside the print area or will cover it, depending on the print file `fill_mode` value.\n\nPositions given below would result in a square image centered vertically within the print area.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"area_width\": 1800,\n  \"area_height\": 2400,\n  \"width\": 1800,\n  \"height\": 1800,\n  \"top\": 300,\n  \"left\": 0\n}\n```\n\n- `area_width` Relative width of the print area.\n\n- `area_height` Relative height of the print area.\n\n- `width` Relative width of your image.\n\n- `height` Relative height of your image.\n\n- `top` Relative image top offset within the area.\n\n- `left` Relative image left offset within the area.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n<strong>Important</strong><br>\nFor posters, canvas, and other products which print files allow rotation (<code>can_rotate</code> value in <a href=\"#operation/getPrintfiles\">print file response</a>) you\ncan flip width and height to create a product mockup that is horizontal or vertical.\n</div>\n\nOnce we have calculated the positions, we can perform the actual mockup generation using\nthe [mockup generator endpoint](#operation/createGeneratorTask):\n`POST` to `https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/create-task/71` with body parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"variant_ids\": [\n    4012,\n    4013,\n    4014,\n    4017,\n    4018,\n    4019\n  ],\n  \"format\": \"jpg\",\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"placement\": \"front\",\n      \"image_url\": \"http://your-site/path-to-front-printfile.jpg\",\n      \"position\": {\n        \"area_width\": 1800,\n        \"area_height\": 2400,\n        \"width\": 1800,\n        \"height\": 1800,\n        \"top\": 300,\n        \"left\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"placement\": \"back\",\n      \"image_url\": \"http://your-site/path-to-back-printfile.jpg\",\n      \"position\": {\n        \"area_width\": 1800,\n        \"area_height\": 2400,\n        \"width\": 1800,\n        \"height\": 1800,\n        \"top\": 300,\n        \"left\": 0\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn response, you will receive the task key and current task status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task_key\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n  \"status\": \"pending\"\n}\n```\n\nAfter an interval of a few seconds, you can try to check for the result by calling a `GET` request\non `https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/task?task_key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`\nIf the task is completed, the response will be like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task_key\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n  \"status\": \"completed\",\n  \"mockups\": [\n    {\n      \"variant_ids\": [\n        4011,\n        4012,\n        4013\n      ],\n      \"placement\": \"front\",\n      \"mockup_url\": \"https://url-to/front-mockup.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"variant_ids\": [\n        4011,\n        4012,\n        4013\n      ],\n      \"placement\": \"back\",\n      \"mockup_url\": \"https://url-to/back-mockup.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"variant_ids\": [\n        4016,\n        4017,\n        4018\n      ],\n      \"placement\": \"front\",\n      \"mockup_url\": \"https://url-to/front-mockup.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"variant_ids\": [\n        4016,\n        4017,\n        4018\n      ],\n      \"placement\": \"back\",\n      \"mockup_url\": \"https://url-to/back-mockup.png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAt this point, you just have to download the mockup URLs and store them on your server and you're good to go!\n\n### Layout templates\n\nIf you wish to build your mockup generator UI, this is the place to start. Using\nthe [layout template endpoint](#operation/getPrintfiles)\nyou can get template images and positions necessary to create a tool where your users can position their files on.\n\nIf you want to create a mug generator, for example, you call the endpoint `/mockup-generator/templates/19` with mug\nproduct ID. By looking at the variant mapping field, we can determine that for variant `1320` 11oz mug we have to use\nthe template with ID `919`. This is what template structure looks like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"template_id\": 919,\n  \"image_url\": \"https://www.printful.com/files/generator/40/11oz_template.png\",\n  \"background_url\": null,\n  \"background_color\": null,\n  \"printfile_id\": 43,\n  \"template_width\": 560,\n  \"template_height\": 295,\n  \"print_area_width\": 520,\n  \"print_area_height\": 202,\n  \"print_area_top\": 18,\n  \"print_area_left\": 20,\n  \"is_template_on_front\": true\n}\n```\n\n- `printfile_id` We can retrieve the actual printfile size from the printfiles endpoint.\n\n- `template_width` This is the main container width, pixels.\n\n- `template_height` Main container height.\n\n- `print_area_width` Inner area where positioning happens.\n\n- `print_area_height` Inner area.\n\n- `print_area_top` Offset from the main container.\n\n- `print_area_left` Offset from the main container.\n\n- `is_template_on_front` This indicates if we should show the user image below or above the template image.\n\nGiven this information, we can create a simple HTML markup:\n\n```html\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; width: 520px; height: 295px;\">\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; width: 520px; height: 202px; top:18px; left:20px; background:rgba(255,233,230,0.33)\">\n        <img alt=\"Printful logo\" src=\"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n             style=\"position: absolute; left: 43px; top: 77px; width: 140px; height: 63px;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; width: 560px; height: 295px; background:url(/files/generator/40/11oz_template.png) center center no-repeat\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWhich would look like this in the browser:\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; width: 520px; height: 295px;\">\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; width: 520px; height: 202px; top:18px; left:20px; background:rgba(255,233,230,0.33)\">\n        <img src=\"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\" alt=\"Printful logo\"\n             style=\"position: absolute; left: 43px; top: 77px; width: 140px; height: 63px;\">\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; width: 560px; height: 295px; background:url(/files/generator/40/11oz_template.png) center center no-repeat\"></div>\n</div>\n\nTo generate mockups with positions above, we perform a `POST` request\nto `https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/create-task/19` with body parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"variant_ids\": [\n    1320\n  ],\n  \"format\": \"jpg\",\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"placement\": \"default\",\n      \"image_url\": \"https://www.printful.test/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\",\n      \"position\": {\n        \"area_width\": 520,\n        \"area_height\": 202,\n        \"width\": 140,\n        \"height\": 63,\n        \"top\": 77,\n        \"left\": 43\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- `area_width` Value of print_area_width in the template.\n- `area_height` Value of print_area_height in the template.\n- `width` Image width.\n- `height` Image height.\n- `top` Image top offset in area.\n- `left` Image left offset in area.\n\n\n### Choosing mockup styles\n\nTo choose which mockup styles to generate, you have to specify `options` and `option_groups` parameters in the request. If these parameters are not present in the request, the system will generate the first available mockup. If you are not planning to utilize all available mockups, it is advised to limit the requested mockups. Not limiting requested mockups will cause bigger task processing times and overall resource waste.\n\nTo find available `options` and `option_groups` for a given product, you have to use `/mockup-generator/printfiles/{id}` endpoint and search for `options` and `option_groups` fields in the response. See examples below.\n\n```\n{\n    \"variant_ids\": [4021],\n    \"format\": \"png\",\n    \"option_groups\": [\"Flat\"],\n    \"options\": [\"Front\"],\n    \"files\": [\n        {\n            \"placement\": \"front\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://www.printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Using lifelike effect\n\nLifelike is a feature that simulates how dark designs will look over dark colour products and is only used in mockup generation. For that, an extra file with special effect is created for each placement.\n\n```\n{\n    \"variant_ids\": [4018],\n    \"format\": \"png\",\n    \"product_options\": {\n      \"lifelike\": true\n    },\n    \"files\": [\n        {\n            \"placement\": \"front\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://www.printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n| Mockup without lifelike                        | Mockup with lifelike                        |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| ![Image](images/lifelike/without_lifelike.png) | ![Image](images/lifelike/with_lifelike.png) |\n"

placement is used it's also necessary to specify thread colors which should be used.\nThread color option must be matched with [appropriate placement](#tag/Common/Options).\n<br />\nTo determine what thread colors could be used you can use [thread color suggestion endpoint](#tag/Examples/File-Library-API-examples/Suggest-thread-colors) and then adjust thread colors manually according to your taste.\n<br />\n<b>Note that you can specify max 6 thread colors</b>\n```\n\"files\": [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"embroidery_outside_left\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.printful.com/static/images/layout/printful-logo.png\"\n    }\n],\n\"options\": [\n    {\n        \"id\": \"thread_colors_outside_left\",\n        \"value\": [\"#FFFFFF\", \"#000000\", \"#96A1A8\", \"#A67843\", \"#FFCC00\", \"#E25C27\"]\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## Automatic thread color\nInstead of providing thread colors manually you can also use the `auto_thread_color` which will match available thread colors to provided image.\n\n```\n\"files\": [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"embroidery_outside_left\",\n        \"url\":

 }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## Unlimited color\nWhen using the embroidery technique you are limited to a range of predefined thread colors. If you would like to use an unlimited range of thread colors please use <b>Unlimited Color</b> (additional cost will be added). To use <b>Unlimited Color</b> add for each file object an extra parameter in options with id: `full_color`.\nWhile using <b>Unlimited Color</b> you don’t need to specify thread colors. The `full_color` option can be used in Orders, Products, Mockup Generator and Ecommerce Platform Sync API.\n\n```\n\"items\": [\n    {\n        \"variant_id\": 4468,\n        \"quantity\": 1,\n        \"files\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"embroidery_back\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.printful.com/static/images/layout/printful-logo.png\",\n                \"options\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"full_color\",\n                        \"value\": true\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n    Unlimited color is available for selected products.\n    To distinguish products with unlimited color option and pricing please \n    see catalog <a href=\"#tag/Examples/Catalog-API-examples/Product-containing-Unlimited-Color-option\">example</a> \n    response for a product with this option available.\n</div>\n\n[Example order](#tag/Examples/Orders-API-examples/Using-full-color-option)\n\n| Mockup without Unlimited Color                               | Mockup with Unlimited Color                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| ![Image](images/unlimited-color/without-unlimited-color.png) | ![Image](images/unlimited-color/with-unlimited-color.png) |\n"

For example a merchant platform.\n\n<pre class=\"mermaid\">\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User as End User\n    participant App as Public App (Marketplace)\n    participant Printful as Printful API\n\n    User->>App: Access Public App (Marketplace)\n    App->>User: Redirect to Printful Authorization Page\n    User->>Printful: Authorize App (Grant Permissions)\n    Printful->>User: Return Authorization Code\n    User->>App: Provide Authorization Code\n    App->>Printful: Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token\n    Printful->>App: Return Access Token\n    App->>User: User Account Linked Successfully\n\n    User->>Printful: Request Product Catalog\n    Printful->>User: Return Product Catalog\n\n    Note over App,User: User can now design and order products\n\n    User->>App: Place Order\n    App->>Printful: Create Order on Behalf of User\n    Printful->>App: Order Created Successfully\n    App->>User: Order Confirmation and Tracking\n\n    Note over App,Printful: App manages multiple users independently\n</pre>\n\nBoth private api token and public app can be created in https://developers.printful.com\n\n## Webshop integration offering pre-designed products to the end customers\n1.Authenticate: Obtain your private API key from the Printful dashboard.\n\n2.Set Up Webhooks: Configure webhooks to receive updates about orders, products, and other events.\n\n3.Sync Products: Use the API to fetch and create designed products in the Printful.\n\n4.Create Orders: Send order data to Printful when a customer places an order on a sync product.\n\n5.Track Orders: Use the API to track the status of orders and shipments.\n\n<pre class=\"mermaid\">\n    graph LR\n    A[Obtain API Key] --> B[Set Up Webhooks]\n    B --> C[Sync Products]\n    C --> D[Create Orders]\n    D --> E[Track Orders]\n    E --> F[Update Webshop]\n</pre>\n\n## Webshop integration with the products designed on the fly by the end customers\n1.Authenticate: Obtain your private API key from the Printful dashboard.  \n\n2.Retrieve Catalog Products: Use the API to fetch available catalog products and display them to customers for customization.  \n\n3.Customize Products: Allow customers to design products (e.g., upload images, select colors, etc.) using your webshop interface.  \n\n4.Create Orders on the Fly: When a customer places an order, send the customized product details and order data directly to Printful.  \n\n5.Track Orders: Use the API to track the status of orders and shipments.  \n\n6.Update Webshop: Update your webshop with order statuses and shipment tracking information.\n\n<pre class=\"mermaid\">\n    graph LR\n    A[Obtain API Key] --> B[Retrieve Catalog Products]\n    B --> C[Customize Products]\n    C --> D[Create Orders on the Fly]\n    D --> E[Track Orders]\n    E --> F[Update Webshop]\n</pre>\n\n## Webshop integration with the product catalog created by the merchant\n<pre class=\"mermaid\">\n    sequenceDiagram\n    participant User as End User\n    participant Merchant\n    participant Printful as Printful API\n\n    User->>Merchant: Access Merchant Platform\n    Merchant->>User: User Account Linked Successfully\n\n    Merchant->>Printful: Authenticate with API Token\n    Printful->>Merchant: Return Authentication Success\n    Note over Merchant,Printful: Merchant can now design and sell products\n\n    Merchant->>Printful: Retrieve Product Catalog\n    Printful->>Merchant: Return Product Catalog\n\n    Merchant->>Printful: Sync Product Data\n    Printful->>Merchant: Product Synced Successfully\n\n    User->>Merchant: Request sync product catalog\n    Merchant->>Printful: Request sync products\n    Printful->>Merchant: Return sync products\n    Merchant->>User: Display sync product catalog\n\n    User->>Merchant: Place Order\n    User->>Printful: Create Order\n    Printful->>Merchant: Order Created Successfully\n    Merchant->>User: Order Confirmation and Tracking\n</pre>\n\n## Embedded Designer integration\nEmbedded designer is embeddable JavaScript component that allows the shop owner not to build their own product designer, but instead use Printful's product designer. It is used to allow design products by the end customers.\nIt is used in conjunction with Printful's product catalog and order API. The end customer can select a product, design it, and then order it.\nThe following diagram illustrates the flow of the embedded designer integration:\n\n<pre class=\"mermaid\">\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Shop[Shop]\n        style Shop fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n        A[Displays Printful Product Catalog]\n        subgraph EDM[Embedded Designer]\n            style EDM fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n            B[Designs Product]\n            C[Saves Design]\n        end\n        D[Orders Product Template]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Printful[Printful API]\n        style Printful fill:#99f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n        E[Processes Order Request]\n    end\n\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n    C --> D\n    D --> E\n    EDM -.-> Printful\n</pre>\n\nThe more detailed flow of the embedded designer integration is as follows:\n<pre class=\"mermaid\">\n    graph TD\n    subgraph Shop[Shop]\n        style Shop fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n        A[Displays Printful Product Catalog]\n        C[Retrieves Nonce Token via API]\n        D[Embeds EDM JavaScript Component]\n        E[Uses Nonce to Establish Single Use Session for EDM]\n        H[Calls Printful API to Order Product Template]\n    end\n\n    subgraph EndCustomer[End Customer]\n        style EndCustomer fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n        B[Selects Product to Design]\n        F[Designs Product in Embedded Designer]\n        G[Saves Design, Producing a Product Template]\n        I[Orders Product Template]\n    end\n\n    subgraph API[Printful API]\n        style API fill:#99f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n        J[Handles Nonce Token Request]\n        K[Processes Order Request]\n        L[Marks Nonce as Used]\n        M[Invalidates Token]\n    end\n\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n    C --> J\n    J --> D\n    D --> E\n    E --> L\n    E --> F\n    F --> G\n    G --> M\n    G --> I\n    I --> H\n    H --> K\n</pre>"

      "description": "## Make your first order through the API\n\n### API Flow Overview\n\nHere's a quick visual overview of how your system communicates with Printful's API during the order creation flow:\n\n![Authentication setup](images/tutorial/api-integration/authentication_setup.png)\n![OAuth integration flow](images/tutorial/api-integration/oauth_integration.png)\n![Order creation and fulfillment](images/tutorial/api-integration/order_creation.png)\n![Webhook handling](images/tutorial/api-integration/product_management.png)\n![Product management](images/tutorial/api-integration/webhook_handling.png)\n\n### Entity Relationship Reference\n\nThe following diagram shows key API entities:\n\n![Entity relationship diagram](images/tutorial/entity_relationship_diagram.png)\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, we're going to show you how to start making orders through the Printful API.\nYou will learn to send postcards to friends or customers through the API,\nand select new images or addresses for every order.\n\nYou'll be able to take the lessons learned here and start making orders for any kind of product \nfor your customers.\n\n### Set up\n\nBefore anything else make sure you have created a native or \"manual order platform store\"\nif you haven't already.\n\n- Go to this link: https://www.printful.com/dashboard/store.\n- Click the \"Create\" button under \"Manual order platform/API\"\n- Choose a name and click continue\n\nAs well as this you will need to create an OAuth token for this store.\n\n- Go to the developer portal: https://developers.printful.com/login\n- Sign in with your Printful account\n- Go to this link: https://developers.printful.com/tokens/add-new-token\n- Make sure you have set the access level to \"A single store\" and select your store\n- Make sure you have the following scopes selected for this tutorial:\n   -  `orders` (\"View and manage orders of the authorized store\")\n- Fill in all other fields as you please\n- Create your token\n- You will receive an access key, you will only see the token once, store it securely\n\n\nTo double-check that your token works, and that you have the right store selected, try running the following command\nreplacing `{your_token}` with the access token created in the developer portal.\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/stores' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\nYou should see your store in the response. If you don't see the right store there, or you get an error,\ndouble-check the token is correct and if necessary create a new token\n\n\n### Making an order\n\nBefore starting let's figure out what we need to make an order through the Printful API.\n\nAccording to [the docs](#operation/createOrder)\nthere are only two fields in the create orders request that are absolutely required,\nthe `recipient` object and the `items` array. So let's focus on those for now.\n\n### The recipient\n\nLet's start with the recipient, this will depend on the location you want to send it to. Mine will\nlook like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"recipients name\",\n    \"address1\": \"12 address avenue, Bankstown\",\n    \"city\": \"Sydney\",\n    \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n    \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n    \"zip\": \"2200\"\n}\n```\n\nNot all state and country codes are accepted by Printful, so I double-check to make sure that\nAU and NSW are accepted by running this curl command:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/countries' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Australia\",\n            \"code\": \"AU\",\n            \"states\": [\n                ...,\n                {\n                    \"code\": \"NSW\",\n                    \"name\": \"New South Wales\"\n                },\n                ...\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extra\": []\n}\n```\n\nSure enough, both codes are there.\n\n**Note**: If your recipient isn't in the US, Australia, or Canada the state code is not necessary.\n[Read more](#tag/CountryState-Code-API).\n\n### The items\n\nWe only want one item, but first, we have to find the `variant_id` of that item.\n\nLet's first see if we can find a category that might have postcards in it, with this command:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/categories' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\nThankfully there's a postcard category.\n\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": [\n        ...,\n        {\n            \"id\": 197,\n            \"parent_id\": 190,\n            \"image_url\": \"https://s3-printful.stage.printful.dev/upload/catalog_category/da/da6caac995335b87ace2d79af70eef5f_t?v=1652883254\",\n            \"title\": \"Postcards\"\n        },\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"extra\": []\n}\n```\n\nNow let's see what options there are in that category\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/products?category_id=197' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\n```\n{\n    \"id\": 433,\n    \"main_category_id\": 197,\n    \"type\": \"POSTCARD\",\n    \"type_name\": \"Standard Postcard\",\n    \"title\": \"Standard Postcard\",\n    \"brand\": null,\n    \"model\": \"Standard Postcard\",\n    \"image\": \"https://s3-printful.stage.printful.dev/products/433/product_1602054891.jpg\",\n    \"variant_count\": 1,\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"options\": [],\n    \"dimensions\": null,\n    \"is_discontinued\": false,\n    \"avg_fulfillment_time\": null,\n    \"techniques\": [\n        {\n            \"key\": \"DIGITAL\",\n            \"display_name\": \"Digital printing\",\n            \"is_default\": true\n        }\n    ],\n    \"files\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"default\",\n            \"type\": \"default\",\n            \"title\": \"Print file\",\n            \"additional_price\": null\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"preview\",\n            \"type\": \"mockup\",\n            \"title\": \"Mockup\",\n            \"additional_price\": null\n        }\n    ],\n    \"description\": \"These postcards are made from thick high-quality matte paper, so they serve as a great addition to a gift or just a thoughtful written note to a friend.\\n• Cardboard paper\\n• Paper weight: 7.67–10.32 oz/yd² (260–350 g/m²)\\n• Size: 4″ × 6″ (101 × 152 mm)\\n• Paper thickness: 0.013″ (0.34 mm)\\n• Coated outer surface\\n• Blank product materials sourced

}\n}\n```\n\nThe standard option looks good so let's get some more information about the product with:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/products/433' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"product\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \"variants\": [\n            {\n

 \"EU_LV\": \"Latvia\",\n                    \"AU\": \"Australia\"\n                },\n                \"availability_status\": [\n                    {\n                        \"region\": \"US\",\n                        \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"region\": \"EU\",\n                        \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"region\": \"EU_LV\",\n                        \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"region\": \"AU\",\n                        \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"extra\": []\n}\n```\n\nOur choice here should be easy, there is only one variant, and it's available in the region\nwe need to send it to.\n\nNow we can add this id (`11513`) to an item in our order payload.\n\n````\n{\n    ...,\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 11513\n        }\n    ]\n}\n````\n\nNext, we need to add a `files` array to the item and decide on the \"`quantity`\" we want to print\n(let's just print 1 for now). This way Printful knows what to print, and how many\nitems should be sent to the recipient.\n\n````\n{\n    \"variant_id\": 11513,\n    \"quantity\": 1,\n    \"files\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"http://example.com/files/posters/poster_1.jpg\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n````\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nNow we can finish our orders payload and create our first order.\nThe final payload should look like this:\n\n````\n{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"recipients name\",\n        \"address1\": \"12 address avenue, Bankstown\",\n        \"city\": \"Sydney\",\n        \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n        \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 11513,\n            \"quantity\": 1,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://example.com/files/posters/poster_1.jpg\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n````\n\nWe can now make a `POST` request to `https://api.printful.com/orders` with this payload, and\nwe'll get a draft order using a request like this:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/orders' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"recipients name\",\n        \"address1\": \"12 address avenue, Bankstown\",\n        \"city\": \"Sydney\",\n        \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n        \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 11513,\n            \"quantity\": 1,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"http://example.com/files/posters/poster_1.jpg\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nNow your order is ready to be made, you will even be able to see the draft already in your\ndashboard here:\n`https://www.printful.com/dashboard/default/orders`\n\n### Confirming an order\n\nTo confirm the order we need the `id` of our new order, it should have been returned by the response to\nthe request above. If you've lost it, you can find it again by making a GET request to\n`https://www.api.printful.com/orders` and find your order in the returned list.\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/orders' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\nAssuming you haven't made any other orders it will probably be the first item returned in that list.\n\nOnce you have your order id you can confirm the order and have it sent to fulfillment.\n\n**Note**: If you do want the order to be fulfilled remember to [set up billing](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/billing/how-does-billing-work).\nIf billing is not set up first the order will fail.\n\n**Warning**: Do not run the following command if you do not want to be charged for this order.\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/orders/{your_order_id}/confirm' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n```\n\n### Automatically confirming new orders\n\nNow I want to be able to send these postcards in one step, without \nneeding to confirm every time.\n\nTo do that, all I have to do is add `confirm=1` as a query parameter to the `POST` request. \nSo that the request looks like this: `POST https://api.printful.com/orders?confirm=1`\n\nNow, whenever I need to send a postcard with a new image I just change the item file URL in this request:\n\n**Warning**: Do not run the following command if you do not want to be charged for this order. \n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/orders?confirm=1' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"recipient name\",\n        \"address1\": \"12 address avenue, Bankstown\",\n        \"city\": \"Sydney\",\n        \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n        \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 11513,\n            \"quantity\": 1,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"{change_this_url}\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nIf I then wanted to send it to someone else all I'd need to do is change the address object.\n\n### Next steps\nTry making some more draft requests like this for different items, and see how they look in the dashboard.\nTry moving the requests into an application you've already created so that your customers can make orders through a UI.\n\nIf you'd like to sell your own products that you've pre-built for your store you\ncan follow our tutorial on [creating products for your store through the API](#tag/Tutorials/Creating-products-for-your-store-through-the-API).\n\n\n## Creating products for your store through the API\n\n### Set up\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you will need to do the following:\n\nMake sure you have created a native or\n\"manual order platform store\" if you haven't already.\n\n- Go to this link: https://www.printful.com/dashboard/store.\n- Click the \"Create\" button under \"Manual order platform/API\"\n- Choose a name and click continue\n\nAs well as this you will need to create an OAuth token for this store.\n\n- Go to the developer portal: https://developers.printful.com/login\n- Sign in with your Printful account\n- Go to this link: https://developers.printful.com/tokens/add-new-token\n- Make sure you have set the access level to \"A single store\" and select your store\n- Make sure you have the following scopes selected:\n    - `orders` View and manage orders of the authorized store\n    - `sync_products` View and manage store products\n- Fill in all other fields as you please\n- Create your token\n- You will receive an access token, you will only see the token once, store it securely\n\nTo double-check that your token works, and that you have the right store selected, try running the following command\nreplacing `{your_token}` with the access token created in the developer portal.\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/stores' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\nYou should see your store there. If you don't see the right store there, or you get an error,\ndouble-check the token is correct and if necessary create a new token\n\n### Get Sync Products\n\nI've created a new store, \"My Photos Store\", and I want to start selling landscapes.\n\nThe first thing I want to do is see what products I have in my store. To do this I will use the\n[Products API](#tag/Products-API), which lets me create, modify and delete products\nin my Printful store.\n\nSo I make this request with curl.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/store/products' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\nAnd it looks like I have no products in my store yet.\n\n**Note**: If you've already created some products you'll see them here.\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": [],\n    \"extra\": [],\n    \"paging\": {\n        \"total\": 0,\n        \"offset\": 0,\n        \"limit\": 20\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo create a new product for our store we'll need to make a post request to that same endpoint.\n\nAccording to [the docs](#operation/createSyncProduct),\nthere are two required fields, an object `sync_product` and an array `sync_variants`.\n\nThe product only has one required field, `name`, and the variants only require the `id`\nand `files` fields to be present.\n\nSo to make a simple first product, let's try and build an object like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"sync_product\": {\n        \"name\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"sync_variants\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 1,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"string\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n```\n\nOur first step is to figure out the `variant_ids` that we need.\n\n### The Printful catalog\n\nMy main goal is to sell landscape photos, so let's check the\n[Get Categories endpoint](#operation/getCategories)\nto see if there's anything suitable for that.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/categories' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"categories\": [\n            ...\n            {\n                \"id\": 55,\n                \"parent_id\": 21,\n                \"image_url\": \"https://s3-printful.stage.printful.dev/upload/catalog_category/6f/6f2f0c50f2558af01e4f8eebbc09a66d_t?v=1652883254\",\n                \"title\": \"Posters\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 56,\n                \"parent_id\": 21,\n                \"image_url\": \"https://s3-printful.stage.printful.dev/upload/catalog_category/34/347883396e6a71fdb25121f20c85e2b3_t?v=1652883254\",\n                \"title\": \"Framed posters\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 57,\n                \"parent_id\": 21,\n                \"image_url\":

      ]\n    },\n    \"extra\": []\n}\n```\n\nPosters, Framed Posters and Canvas prints all sound suitable.\nThough I'd prefer my photos framed before sending them to customers, so I will look into\nthe category with `id` `56`.\n\nSee if you can find a product that suits your needs best from the list returned from the `/categories` endpoint.\n\nTo see all options for framed posters let's use the `category_id` (`56`)\nwith the [Get Products endpoint](#operation/getProducts).\n\nWe can pass the `id` of the category we're interested in as a query parameter, so I'll pass `56` in as a parameter with a\nrequest:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/products?category_id=56' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\nThis returns 4 products in an array:\n\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 2,\n            \"main_category_id\": 56,\n            \"title\": \"Enhanced Matte Paper Framed Poster (in)\",\n            ...\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 304,\n            \"main_category_id\": 56,\n            \"title\": \"Enhanced Matte Paper Framed Poster (cm)\",\n            ...\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 366,\n            \"main_category_id\": 56,\n            \"title\": \"Framed Poster with Frame Mat (cm)\",\n            ...\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 172,\n            \"main_category_id\": 56,\n            \"title\": \"Premium Luster Photo Paper Framed Poster (in)\",\n            ...\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extra\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis will give us a lot of information about the products,\nbut all we really need at this point is the `id`.\n\nI'm interested in that \"Premium Luster Photo Paper Framed Poster (in)\" product,\nso to find what variants are available to me, I'll search for it by its `id`\n(`172`) and find the `variant_id`s I'm looking for.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/products/172' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"product\": {\n            \"id\": 172,\n

the regions I want to sell in\nand a small 8x10 sounds like a great first product for my store.\n\n### Your first sync product and sync variant\n\nNow we can finish this payload from before:\n\n```\n{\n    \"sync_product\": {\n        \"name\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"sync_variants\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 1,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"url\": \"string\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nI'll name my product \"Framed Landscape Poster\" so my object will look like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"sync_product\": {\n        \"name\": \"Framed Landscape Poster\"\n    },\n    \"sync_variants\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 10760,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n

--location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/store/products' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n  \"sync_product\": {\n    \"name\": \"Framed Landscape Poster\"\n  },\n    \"sync_variants\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 10760,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n

\"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"id\": 280896090,\n        \"external_id\": \"6308d1498007d7\",\n        \"name\": \"Framed Landscape Poster\",\n        \"variants\": 1,\n        \"synced\": 1,\n        \"thumbnail_url\": null,\n        \"is_ignored\": false\n    },\n    \"extra\": []\n}\n```\n\nAnd when I go back to see the products in my store\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/store/products' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\nI see the new product:\n\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": [\n        {\n

}\n}\n```\n\nAnd I can see more details about the product with this request now.\n\n**Note**: Replace the `{your_product_id}` at the end with the `id` of your sync product, i.e.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/store/products/{your_product_id}' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\nFor me, the request will look like this, but you will have a different id:\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/store/products/280896090' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\n\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n

might look something like this\n\n``` \n{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"name\",\n        \"address1\": \"address\",\n        \"city\": \"city\",\n        \"state_code\": \"STATE_CODE\",\n        \"country_code\": \"COUNTRY_CODE\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"sync_variant_id\": 3374445206,\n            \"quantity\": 1,\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nWe can make a draft order with this command:\n\n**Note**: You will need to swap `{your_sync_variant_id}` out with your own `sync_variant_id`\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/orders' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"name\",\n        \"address1\": \"address\",\n        \"city\": \"city\",\n        \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n        \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"sync_variant_id\": {your_sync_variant_id},\n            \"quantity\": 1\n        }\n    ]\n}\n'\n```\n\n### Next steps\nTo learn more about making an order see:\n[Make your first order through the API](#tag/Tutorials/Make-your-first-order-through-the-API).\n\n## Ordering a Direct to Garment (DTG) and an Embroidery Product through the API\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, we're going to make an order and design one of Printful's\nmost popular items, the **Unisex Staple T-Shirt | Bella + Canvas 3001**.\nYou will learn how to define file placements and product options when ordering DTG and embroidery products.\n\n### Set up\n\nBefore anything else make sure you have created a native or \"manual order platform store\"\nif you haven't already.\n\n- Go to this link: https://www.printful.com/dashboard/store\n- Click the \"Create\" button under \"Manual order platform/API\"\n- Choose a name and click continue\n\nAs well as this you will need to create an OAuth token for this store.\n\n- Go to the developer portal: https://developers.printful.com/login\n- Sign in with your Printful account\n- Go to this link: https://developers.printful.com/tokens/add-new-token\n- Make sure you have set the access level to \"A single store\" and select your store\n- Make sure you have the following scopes selected for this tutorial:\n  -  `orders` (\"View and manage orders of the authorized store\")\n- Fill in all other fields as you please\n- Create your token\n- You will receive an access key, you will only see the token once, store it securely\n\n\nTo double-check that your token works and that you have the right store selected, try running the following command\nreplacing `your_token` with the access token created in the developer portal.\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/stores' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\nYou should see your store in the response. If you don't see the right store there, or you get an error,\ndouble-check the token is correct and if necessary create a new token.\n\n### Making the order\nWe won't go through all the details on how to make an order in this tutorial, instead we will start with the following \nJSON object, which we can use as the basis for constructing an order. \n\n```\n{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"recipients name\",\n        \"address1\": \"12 address avenue, Bankstown\",\n        \"city\": \"Sydney\",\n        \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n        \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 4035,\n            \"quantity\": 1\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe `recipient` object describes where, and to whom, I want to send the order. Inside the `items`\narray I have one object with `variant_id` `4035` which is this T-Shirt:\n\n<img alt=\"variant_id 4035\" src=\"https://s3-printful.stage.printful.dev/products/71/4035_1581408351.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>\n\nDescribed in JSON like this:\n```\n{\n    \"id\": 4035,\n    \"product_id\": 71,\n    \"name\": \"Bella + Canvas 3001 Unisex Short Sleeve Jersey T-Shirt with Tear Away Label (Asphalt / 2XL)\",\n    \"size\": \"2XL\",\n    \"color\": \"Asphalt\",\n    \"color_code\": \"#52514f\",\n    \"color_code2\": null,\n    \"image\": \"https://s3-printful.stage.printful.dev/products/71/4035_1581408351.jpg\",\n    \"price\": \"12.55\",\n    \"in_stock\": true,\n    \"availability_regions\": {\n        \"US\": \"United States\",\n        \"EU\": \"Europe\",\n        \"EU_LV\": \"Latvia\",\n        \"EU_ES\": \"Spain\",\n        \"AU\": \"Australia\",\n        \"CA\": \"Canada\",\n        \"UK\": \"United Kingdom\"\n    },\n    \"availability_status\": [\n        {\n            \"region\": \"US\",\n            \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"region\": \"EU\",\n            \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"region\": \"EU_LV\",\n            \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"region\": \"EU_ES\",\n            \"status\": \"stocked_on_demand\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"region\": \"AU\",\n            \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"region\": \"CA\",\n            \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"region\": \"UK\",\n            \"status\": \"in_stock\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nIf you'd like more detail, we have a tutorial to help you\n[make your first order through the API](#tag/Tutorials/Make-your-first-order-through-the-API).\n\n### Adding placements\nWe already know what we want to order. But now we want to add our design to the image. I want to print the following design\non the right sleeve and the back of the T-Shirt.\n\n![Printful logo](https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png)\n\n\nFirst let's make sure that's actually possible, by making a request to the `variants` endpoint.\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/products/variant/4035' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n**Note**: You could also do this with a request to the Products endpoint as this information will be the same for each variant of a product.\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/products/71' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\nYou will see what file placements are available under `result.product.files`. As of writing this tutorial the following placements are\navailable:\n```\n...\n\"files\": [\n  {\n      \"id\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      \"title\": \"Left chest\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.60\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"embroidery_large_center\",\n      \"type\": \"embroidery_large_center\",\n      \"title\": \"Large center\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"3.25\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"embroidery_chest_center\",\n      \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_center\",\n      \"title\": \"Center chest\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.60\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"embroidery_sleeve_left_top\",\n      \"type\": \"embroidery_sleeve_left_top\",\n      \"title\": \"Left sleeve top\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.60\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"embroidery_sleeve_right_top\",\n      \"type\": \"embroidery_sleeve_right_top\",\n      \"title\": \"Right sleeve top\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.60\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"default\",\n      \"type\": \"front\",\n      \"title\": \"Front print\",\n      \"additional_price\": null\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"front_large\",\n      \"type\": \"front_large\",\n      \"title\": \"Large front print\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"5.25\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"back\",\n      \"type\": \"back\",\n      \"title\": \"Back print\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"5.25\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"label_outside\",\n      \"type\": \"label_outside\",\n      \"title\": \"Outside label\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.20\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"label_inside\",\n      \"type\": \"label_inside\",\n      \"title\": \"Inside label\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.20\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"sleeve_left\",\n      \"type\": \"sleeve_left\",\n      \"title\": \"Left sleeve\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.20\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"sleeve_right\",\n      \"type\": \"sleeve_right\",\n      \"title\": \"Right sleeve\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.20\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"id\": \"preview\",\n      \"type\": \"mockup\",\n      \"title\": \"Mockup\",\n      \"additional_price\": null\n  }\n],\n...\n```\n\nThankfully \"Right sleeve\" (`sleeve_right`) and \"Back print\" (`back`) are among the available options for this product.\n\n```\n  ...\n  {\n      \"id\": \"back\",\n      \"type\": \"back\",\n      \"title\": \"Back print\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"5.25\"\n  },\n  ...\n  {\n      \"id\": \"sleeve_right\",\n      \"type\": \"sleeve_right\",\n      \"title\": \"Right sleeve\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.20\"\n  },\n  ...\n```\nThe most important thing here is the `type` field, that's what we will use to indicate where we want our files to be placed.\n\n### Adding the image placements to the items\nNow we can add our designs to the item object. To do that we need a `files` array containing the source of our images.\n\nIn our [previous article](#tag/Tutorials/Make-your-first-order-through-the-API) on making orders, we already added a file to an item, \nand it looked like this:\n```\n{\n    \"variant_id\": 4035,\n    \"quantity\": 1,\n    \"files\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis won't work for us though, because it doesn't specify the placement. The above payload\nwill use the `default` placement because no other was specified. If we use the default the image\nwill be printed on the `front` for this product.\n\nTo have the placement on the back instead, let's add a `type` field to the `file` object\n```\n{\n    \"type\": \"back\",\n    \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n}\n```\nThen we can add another object to the `files` array doing the same but with `sleeve_right` as the type so that our final item\nlooks like this.\n```\n{\n    \"variant_id\": 4035,\n    \"quantity\": 1,\n    \"files\": [\n      { \n        \"type\": \"back\",\n        \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n      },\n      { \n        \"type\": \"sleeve_right\",\n        \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n      }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Ordering the product\nWe can already make our order as a draft with this request:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/orders' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"recipients name\",\n        \"address1\": \"12 address avenue, Bankstown\",\n        \"city\": \"Sydney\",\n        \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n        \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n          \"variant_id\": 4035,\n          \"quantity\": 1,\n          \"files\": [\n            { \n              \"type\": \"back\",\n              \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n            },\n            { \n              \"type\": \"sleeve_right\",\n              \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n            }\n          ]\n      }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nIn the response, you'll find a link to the order in the dashboard.\n\n```\n...\n\"dashboard_url\": \"https://www.printful.com/dashboard?order_id={your_order_id}\"\n...\n```\nIn the dashboard, you'll be able to view the order and see how your item looks on a mockup. You may have to wait\nfor the mockup to be generated.\n\n**Note**: This can be done programmatically through the API as well, using the Mockup Generator API.\n\n### File position\nThe print file on the `back` placement didn't look how I expected. I wanted the image towards the top and the middle.\nSo, I will update the order and pass a position object along with the item using a `PUT` request to\nthe `orders` endpoint.\n\nThe position object looks like this:\n```\n{\n    \"area_width\": 1200,\n    \"area_height\": 1600,\n    \"width\": 300,\n    \"height\": 100,\n    \"top\": 100,\n    \"left\": 450\n}\n```\nThis object creates an invisible background for your image, which you can use to place your image in a more specific location.\n`area_width` and `area_height` are used to create the area your image will be placed on top of. `width` and `height` can\nbe used to resize your image. `top` and `left` refer to how far away the image should be placed from the top and left\nrespectively.\n\nThese numbers are relative and don't refer to centimeters, inches, or pixels. So the following `placement` object is the same as the previous one:\n```\n{\n    \"area_width\": 12,\n    \"area_height\": 16,\n    \"width\": 3,\n    \"height\": 1,\n    \"top\": 1,\n    \"left\": 4.5\n}\n```\n\nThis is the request I make to update the order:\n```\ncurl --location --request PUT 'https://api.printful.com/orders/{your_order_id}' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n          \"variant_id\": 4035,\n          \"quantity\": 1,\n          \"files\": [\n            { \n              \"type\": \"back\",\n              \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\",\n              \"position\": {\n                  \"area_width\": 1200,\n                  \"area_height\": 1600,\n                  \"width\": 300,\n                  \"height\": 100,\n                  \"top\": 100,\n                  \"left\": 450\n              }\n            },\n            { \n              \"type\": \"sleeve_right\",\n              \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n            }\n          ]\n      }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\n### Adding embroidery\nNow that I have an order with direct to garment prints made, I'd also like to have my design embroidered.\n\nFor the embroidered version of the T-Shirt I'd like the design to be on the chest towards the left,\nwhere a pocket might be on another shirt. Thankfully, we've already seen that top left is an option for this shirt\n\n```\n{\n      \"id\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      \"title\": \"Left chest\",\n      \"additional_price\": \"2.60\"\n}\n```\n\nSo let's try and make our previous `POST` request again, but this time with only the `embroidery_chest_left` file type:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/orders' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"recipients name\",\n        \"address1\": \"12 address avenue, Bankstown\",\n        \"city\": \"Sydney\",\n        \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n        \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n          \"variant_id\": 4035,\n          \"quantity\": 1,\n          \"files\": [\n            { \n              \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n              \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n            }\n          ]\n      }\n    ]\n}'\n```\nUnfortunately, embroidery items work a bit differently, so if we make that request we'll get this error:\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 400,\n    \"result\": \"Item 0: thread_colors_chest_left option is missing or incorrect!

I'd like a black and white effect,\nso I need to add the option `thread_colors_chest_left` to the item along with the first two allowed values\nfrom the error message.\n\n```\n{\n  \"variant_id\": 4035,\n  \"quantity\": 1,\n  \"files\": [\n    { \n      \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"options\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"thread_colors_chest_left\",\n      \"value\": [\"#000000\", \"#FFFFFF\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n**Note**: The options are a property of the **item** object not of the file.\n\nNow to make that order we can make a request like this:\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/orders' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"recipient\": {\n        \"name\": \"recipients name\",\n        \"address1\": \"12 address avenue, Bankstown\",\n        \"city\": \"Sydney\",\n        \"state_code\": \"NSW\",\n        \"country_code\": \"AU\",\n        \"zip\": \"2200\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"variant_id\": 4035,\n            \"quantity\": 1,\n            \"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"options\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"thread_colors_chest_left\",\n                    \"value\": [\"#000000\", \"#FFFFFF\"]\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\n### Next steps\nWe've made these orders, but we haven't confirmed them yet, so they are just drafts. For more information on making orders, you can\nlook through the documentation [here](#tag/Orders-API) or follow our other tutorial [Make your first order through the API](#tag/Tutorials/Make-your-first-order-through-the-API).\n\nOr if you would like these items to be more reusable as items in your store you can follow our tutorial on [creating products for your store through the API](#tag/Tutorials/Creating-products-for-your-store-through-the-API).\n\n## Creating Mockups in the API\n### Introduction\nIn our previous tutorials we created products that can be ordered by ourselves or our customers.\nHowever, if we're going to order a product, or offer it to a customer, we'll want to know what\nit looks like first. That's where mockups come in.\n\nIn this tutorial, we're going to create mockups for some of the products we built in previous tutorials.\n\n### Set up\n\nBefore anything else make sure you have created a native or \"manual order platform store\"\nif you haven't already.\n\n- Go to this link: https://www.printful.com/dashboard/store\n- Click the \"Create\" button under \"Manual order platform/API\"\n- Choose a name and click create\n\nAs well as this you will need to create an OAuth token for this store.\n\n- Go to the developer portal: https://developers.printful.com/login\n- Sign in with your Printful account\n- Go to this link: https://developers.printful.com/tokens/add-new-token\n- Make sure you have set access level to \"A single store\" and select your store\n- Make sure you have the following scopes selected for this tutorial:\n  -  `orders` (\"View and manage orders of the authorized store\")\n- Fill in all other fields as you please\n- Create your token\n- You will receive an access key, you will only see the token once, store it securely\n\n### Deciding which variants to generate\nIn one of our previous tutorials, [Ordering a Direct to Garment (DTG) and an Embroidery Product through the API](#tag/Tutorials/Ordering-a-Direct-to-Garment-(DTG)-and-an-Embroidery-Product-through-the-API).\nLet's make some mockups for that same T-Shirt.\n\nWhen we originally made the T-Shirt, we only had the `Asphalt` color, but I'd also like to\ndisplay a `Black` and `White` variant as well. So, I find the `id` of the T-Shirt product I want,\n`71`, and make a `GET` request to `https://api.printful.com/products/71`.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/products/71' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\nThis will provide you with, among other things, a list of variants. Among those variants,\nyou will find the Asphalt variant  `4035` we created in the previous tutorial. We will also find\na variant with the color black `4020` and a variant with the color white `4015`.\n\nNow we need to get the files from our previous tutorial and put them into a new files array using the format\nof the [Mockup Generator API](#tag/Mockup-Generator-API).\n\nSo if we had files from an order that looked like this:\n```\n  \"files\": [\n    { \n      \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      \"url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\"\n      \"position\": {\n        \"area_width\": 1800,\n        \"area_height\": 2400,\n        \"width\": 1800,\n        \"height\": 1800,\n        \"top\": 300,\n        \"left\": 0\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\nOur new files array will look like this:\n``` \n  \"files\": [\n\t{ \n\t\t\"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n\t\t\"image_url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\",\n\t\t\"position\": {\n\t\t  \"area_width\": 1800,\n\t\t  \"area_height\": 2400,\n\t\t  \"width\": 1800,\n\t\t  \"height\": 1800,\n\t\t  \"top\": 300,\n\t\t  \"left\": 0\n\t\t}\n\t}\n  ]\n```\n\nTo generate the mockups for these variants we can put these files and `variant_id`s in\na single `POST` request to `https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/create-task/{product_id}`.\n\n``` \ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/create-task/71' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"variant_ids\": [\n        4035,\n        4020,\n        4015\n    ],\n  \"files\": [\n    { \n      \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      \"image_url\": \"https://printful.com/static/images/layout/logo-printful.png\",\n      \"position\": {\n        \"area_width\": 1800,\n        \"area_height\": 2400,\n        \"width\": 1800,\n        \"height\": 1800,\n        \"top\": 300,\n        \"left\": 0\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n```\n\nThis will give you a response like this:\n```\n{\n   \"code\" : 200,\n   \"extra\" : [],\n   \"result\" : {\n      \"status\" : \"pending\",\n      \"task_key\" : \"gt-421699980\"\n   }\n}\n```\nYou'll notice that there are no mockups in the response, instead, you receive a `task_key`\nwhich you can use to retrieve the actual mockup:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/task?task_key=gt-421699980' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}'\n```\n\n```\n{\n   \"code\" : 200,\n   \"extra\" : [],\n   \"result\" : {\n      \"mockups\" : [\n         {\n            \"extra\" : [\n               {\n                  \"option\" : \"Front\",\n                  \"option_group\" : \"Men's\",\n                  \"title\" : \"Front\",\n                  \"url\" : \"https://printful-upload.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/tmp/ca321525cfd907188c2266fb6a41cf94/unisex-staple-t-shirt-black-front-634d3ec02e655.png\"\n               },\n               {\n                  \"option\" : \"Front\",\n                  \"option_group\" : \"Flat\",\n                  \"title\" : \"Front\",\n                  \"url\" : \"https://printful-upload.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/tmp/a3560e3a7558374cfdb2bb6c53ccee18/unisex-staple-t-shirt-black-front-634d3ec02e945.png\"\n               }\n            ],\n            \"mockup_url\" : \"https://printful-upload.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/tmp/e2a9e33986914a13096d60847be8a5b0/unisex-staple-t-shirt-black-zoomed-in-634d3ec02dafc.png\",\n            \"placement\" : \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n            \"variant_ids\" : [\n               4020\n            ]\n         },\n         {\n            ...\n            \"variant_ids\" : [\n               4035\n            ]\n         },\n         {\n            ...\n            \"variant_ids\" : [\n               4015\n            ]\n         }\n      ],\n      \"printfiles\" : [\n         {\n            \"placement\" : \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n            \"url\" : \"https://printful-upload.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/tmp/81aabb08df3df89bf67edbd0540fcbe1/printfile_embroidery_chest_left.png\",\n            \"variant_ids\" : [\n               4020,\n               4035,\n               4015\n            ]\n         }\n      ],\n      \"status\" : \"completed\",\n      \"task_key\" : \"gt-421709941\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's it, now we have three mockups for each variant, one is an image of the front of the T-Shirt with no model,\nand the other two are the front of the T-Shirt with a model.\n\nThe only problem is that these default mockups only give me one kind of model or style\nTo change the style of my mockups I'll need to find the `options` and `option_groups` that will help create different mockup styles.\n\n### Options and Option Groups\n#### What are options and option_groups?\nIn the context of mockup generation `options`, generally speaking, refer to the part of the product being displayed.\n`option_groups` refers to the \"style\" of the mockup. For example \"Front\" refers to an `option` but \"Wrinkled\" or \"On Hanger\"\nare `option_groups`.\n\n#### Finding options and option_groups\nTo find what `options` and `option_groups` are available I make a request to `mockup-generator/printfiles/{product_id}`:\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/printfiles/71' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \n```\nGiving the following response:\n```\n{\n   \"code\" : 200,\n   \"extra\" : [],\n   \"result\" : {\n      \"available_placements\" : {\n\t      ...\n      },\n      \"option_groups\" : [\n            \"Couple's\",\n            \"Flat\",\n            \"Flat 2\",\n            \"Flat Lifestyle\",\n            \"Folded\",\n            \"Halloween\",\n            \"Holiday season\",\n            \"Men's\",\n            \"Men's 2\",\n            \"Men's 3\",\n            \"Men's 4\",\n            \"Men's 5\",\n            \"Men's Lifestyle\",\n            \"Men's Lifestyle 2\",\n            \"Men's Lifestyle 3\",\n            \"Men's Lifestyle 4\",\n            \"On Hanger\",\n            \"Product details\",\n            \"Red, white & blue\",\n            \"Spring/summer vibes\",\n            \"Valentine's Day\",\n            \"Women's\",\n            \"Women's 2\",\n            \"Women's 3\",\n            \"Women's 4\",\n            \"Women's 5\",\n            \"Women's Lifestyle\",\n            \"Women's Lifestyle 2\",\n            \"Women's Lifestyle 3\",\n            \"Wrinkled\"\n      ],\n      \"options\" : [\n \t ...\n         \"Front\",\n\t ...\n      ],\n      \"printfiles\" : [\n         ...\n      ],\n      \"product_id\" : 71,\n      \"variant_printfiles\" : [\n\t...\n      ]\n   }\n}\n\n```\n\nI'd like to have mockups for both genders, so I've already created \"Men's\" mockups.\nSo, I can make the request again, specifying that I want the \"Women's\" `option_group`\n\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/create-task/71' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"variant_ids\": [\n        4035,\n        4020,\n        4015\n    ],\n  \"files\": [\n    { \n      \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      \"image_url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Ercole_de%27_roberti%2C_san_michele_arcangelo_louvre_01.jpg\",\n      \"position\": {\n\t    \"area_width\": 1800,\n\t\t\"area_height\": 2400,\n\t\t\"width\": 1800,\n\t\t\"height\": 1800,\n\t\t\"top\": 300,\n\t\t\"left\": 0\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"options\": [\"Front\"],\n  \"option_groups\": [\"Women'\\''s\"]\n\n}'\n```\n\nRepeating the steps from before, results in new mockups for each variant, but now with a different model.\n\nIf I also want to receive additional styles (`option_groups`) I just need to add it to the option groups.\nFor example, these option groups will give me mockups for \"Men's 2\", \"Women's\" and \"Couple's\".\n```\n  \"option_groups\": [\"Men's 2\", \"Women's\", \"Couple's\"]\n```\n\n#### Mismatched options\nIt is possible to add `options` or `option_groups` that don't produce any mockups.\n\nFor example, if I try and make the previous request with `\"options\": [\"Back\"]` I will\nreceive a `400` error:\n```\n{\n   \"code\" : 400,\n   \"error\" : {\n      \"message\" : \"No variants to generate. Option filters may exclude all variants or variants are not available. Alternatively, make sure that variants belong to given product id.\",\n      \"reason\" : \"BadRequest\"\n   },\n   \"result\" : \"No variants to generate. Option filters may exclude all variants or variants are not available. Alternatively, make sure that variants belong to given product id.\"\n}\n```\nThis is because all the print files are on the front, so Printful can't produce a mockup for the \"Back\".\n\nBut if our request had a print file on the back the request would succeed for. For example:\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/create-task/71' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"variant_ids\": [\n        4035,\n        4020,\n        4015\n    ],\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"back\",\n      \"image_url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Ercole_de%27_roberti%2C_san_michele_arcangelo_louvre_01.jpg\",\n      \"position\": {\n              \"area_width\": 1800,\n                \"area_height\": 2400,\n                \"width\": 1800,\n                \"height\": 1800,\n                \"top\": 300,\n                \"left\": 0\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"options\": [\"Back\"],\n  \"option_groups\": [\"Women'\\''s\"]\n\n}'\n```\n\n#### Multiple options and option_groups\nIt is also possible to have multiple `options`. For example, assuming we have the right variants and print files,\nthe following combination would produce mockups of the back and front of the product, for \"Men's\" \"Women's\".\n\n```\n  \"options\": [\"Front\", \"Back\"],\n  \"option_groups\": [\"Men's 2\", \"Women's\"]\n```\nHowever, you should attempt to limit the number of `options` and `option_groups` you provide here as much as possible.\nOtherwise, you may get combinations that don't match resulting in unexpected results that you won't see until after generation.\n\nThe following request will not give `400`, instead, it will produce the `\"Front\"` mockups and ignore the `\"Back\"`\nmockups.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.printful.com/mockup-generator/create-task/71' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"variant_ids\": [\n        ...\n    ],\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"embroidery_chest_left\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ],\n  \"options\": [\"Front\", \"Back\"],\n  \"option_groups\": [\"Men'\\''s 2\", \"Women'\\''s\"]\n}'\n```\nWithout the `400` message you may think you are producing mockups that are actually impossible to produce.\nIf these requests are part of a larger system, it could mean that you end up promising mockups\nto your users that are actually impossible.\n\nAdditionally, mockup generation can be slow, each new option group will add new mockups\nmultiplied by the amount of variants and options you have. In a user facing application\ngenerating too many mockups for users might be unacceptably slow.\n\n**It is usually safer to make multiple requests with limited than one large request that attempts to generate a large range of different mockups**\n\n### Next Steps\nNow that you've created a basic mockup try and create some mockups for your products.\nAfter that you can save the results somewhere on your server and use your new mockups however you like.\n\nYou could also update the `thumbnail` of one of your existing store products.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request PUT 'https://api.printful.com/store/products/{sync_product_id}' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token}' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"sync_product\": {\n        \"thumbnail\": \"{url_of_your_new_mockup}\"\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nIf you don't have any products in your store yet, check out our tutorial on that subject,\n[Creating products for your store through the API](#tag/Tutorials/Creating-products-for-your-store-through-the-API).\n[Make your first order through the API](#tag/Tutorials/Make-your-first-order-through-the-API).\n\n## Integrating with ECommerce Platforms through the API\n### Introduction\nIn this tutorial, we will show you how to integrate with your ECommerce Sync Products through the API. \nWe will retrieve our products, update sync variants, and send out notifications.\n\nSuppose we have a new store that is selling a range of products with a design that changes every year, \nit could be for a conference or maybe for a holiday like Christmas. We have a very large range of products and at the moment our designers have to update all the products manually every year. We want to offer our designers a way to update all of these products at once through the API.\n\n\n### Set up\n\nBefore anything else make sure you have created a store using one of our integrations.\nYou can choose a platform here: https://www.printful.com/dashboard/store/connect, and \nfind additional tutorials to help you set it up.\n\nAs well as this you will need to create an OAuth token for this store.\n\n- Go to the developer portal: https://developers.printful.com/login\n- Sign in with your Printful account\n- Go to this link: https://developers.printful.com/tokens/add-new-token\n- Make sure you have set access level to \"A single store\" and select your store\n- Make sure you have the following scopes selected for this tutorial:\n  -  `webhooks` (\"View and manage store webhooks\")\n  -  `sync_products` (\"View and manage store products\")\n- Fill in all other fields as you please\n- Create your token\n- You will receive an access key, you will only see the token once, store it securely\n\n### Limitations\nFor the most part, the ECommerce API works just like the Products API, but there are a couple of important limitations. \nThese limitations are explained here: https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Ecommerce-Platform-Sync-API. But, for the \npurposes of this tutorial, the most important thing is that it’s not possible to create new sync products directly through the API.\n\n### Retrieving Products and Variants\nFirst, let's find the products from last year's Christmas sale\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/sync/products' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token} \\ \n```\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 290959495,\n            \"external_id\": \"christmas_636b6f729a37c7\",\n            \"name\": \"Unisex t-shirt | Christmas\",\n            \"variants\": 1,\n            \"synced\": 1,\n            \"thumbnail_url\": \"https://files.cdn.printful.com/files/thumbnail/christmas.png\",\n            \"is_ignored\": false\n        },\n    ...\n    ],\n    \"extra\": [],\n    \"paging\": {\n        \"total\": 143,\n        \"offset\": 0,\n        \"limit\": 20\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we will need to loop through these products to find the variants.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'https://api.printful.com/sync/products/{id} \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token} \\\n```\n\nFor that first product we might get a list of variants that looks like this\n```\n{\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"sync_product\": {\n            \"id\": 290959495,\n            \"external_id\": \"636b6f729a37c7\",\n            \"name\": \"Unisex t-shirt | Christmas\",\n            \"variants\": 1,\n            \"synced\": 1,\n            \"thumbnail_url\": \"https://files.cdn.printful.com/files/6bf/6bfceb21e5fa7a854ff915ca66ca3a79_preview.png\",\n            \"is_ignored\": false\n        },\n        \"sync_variants\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 3590218032,\n                \"external_id\": \"636b6f729a3867\",\n                \"sync_product_id\": 290959495,\n                \"name\": \"Unisex t-shirt | Christmas\",\n                \"synced\": true,\n                \"variant_id\": 9575,\n                \"main_category_id\": 24,\n                \"warehouse_product_id\": 330125,\n                \"warehouse_product_variant_id\": 394380,\n                \"retail_price\": \"37.25\",\n                \"sku\": \"636B6F729A302\",\n                \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n                \"product\": {\n                    \"variant_id\": 9575,\n                    \"product_id\": 71,\n                    \"image\": \"https://s3-printful.stage.printful.dev/products/71/9575_1581408916.jpg\",\n                    \"name\": \"Bella + Canvas 3001 Unisex Short Sleeve Jersey T-Shirt with Tear Away Label (Black Heather / XS)\"\n                },\n           \"files\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 490457488,\n                    \"type\": \"default\",\n                    \"hash\": null,\n                    \"url\": \"https://example.com/file_for_christmas_2022.jpg\",\n                    \"filename\": null,\n                    \"mime_type\": null,\n                    \"size\": 0,\n                    \"width\": null,\n                    \"height\": null,\n                    \"dpi\": null,\n                    \"status\": \"ok\",\n                    \"created\": 1681472128,\n                    \"thumbnail_url\": null,\n                    \"preview_url\": null,\n                    \"visible\": true,\n                    \"is_temporary\": false\n                }\n            ],\n\n                ],\n                \"options\": [\n                    ...\n                ],\n                \"is_ignored\": false\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"extra\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Updating a Sync Variant\nAs you can see from the request above the image is for 2022, https://example.com/file_for_christmas_2022.jpg,\nand we want to update so that we use the new 2023 image. For that all we need to do is send a PUT request to the endpoint\n\n```\ncurl --location --request PUT 'https://api.printful.com/sync/variant/3590218032' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token} \\\n--data '{\n    \"files\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"default\",\n            \"url\": \"https://example.com/file_for_christmas_2023.jpg\"\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nThis will replace the original 2022 files with the new 2023 files.\n\nNow, rather than changing each product individually the designers could simply \nsend you the new design, or use your custom UI. You will then be able to loop \nthrough all the relevant variants, replacing the old file for each variant.\n\n**Note** when looping through anything within the API remember to keep within the\n[rate limits](#section/About-the-Printful-API/Rate-Limits)\n\n### Setting Up a Webhook For Newly Synced Products\nWebhooks are another opportunity for the automation of your ECommmerce website through the API. \nSuppose you want to inform your customers everytime your team creates a new Sync Product. This can be automated using webhooks.\n\nFirst, you will need to listen for webhooks coming from Printful. We can’t help with setting up a server to do that,\nbut you can use our [webhook simulator](https://www.printful.com/api/webhook-simulator).\n\nThe webhook you will be listening for is: [**product_synced**](#operation/productSynced).\nTo configure the webhook make the following request\n\n```\ncurl --location -X POST 'https://api.printful.com/webhooks' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_token} \\\n--data '{\n  \"url\": \"https://your.site/path/to/webhook-listener\",\n  \"types\": [\n      \"product_synced\"\n  ]\n}'\n```\n\nNow, whenever a new product is synced to Printful, Printful will POST to the new product to that endpoint in this format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"product_synced\",\n  \"created\": 1681473307,\n  \"retries\": 1,\n  \"store\": {your_store_id},\n  \"data\": {\n    \"sync_product\": {\n      \"id\": 4567234,\n      \"external_id\": \"christmas_collection-1234\",\n      \"name\": \"Mug | Christmas\",\n      \"variants\": 1,\n      \"synced\": 1\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nNow, whenever you receive the webhook you can send updates to your customers about the new product that was just synced.\n\n### Next steps\nAfter updating your products you may also want to [generate mockups through the Mockup Generator API](#tag/Tutorials/Creating-Mockups-in-the-API).\n\nIf you have a Native Store, you should check [our tutorial on the Store Products API](#tag/Tutorials/Creating-products-for-your-store-through-the-API)."
